Aim
---

- get more developers building on buddycloud
- show [web initially] developers how easy it is to start adding messaging to their application
- a new recipe every week
- guest contributors
- simple and solves a specific solution (make a chat client in 5 minutes vs. build an entire social network)

Assume
------
- no buddycloud account (so the first step should be to create a user)
- no knowlege of XMPP
- no interest in learning XMPP
- no webserver (deploy to 127.0.0.1)
- has javascript experience

Format
------

- end result eg:
`Build a simple webrtc client that can call your friends`
- difficultly level:
`<easy|medium|difficult>`
- ingredients
a list of everything needed to start working eg:
```
Ingredients:
- skeleton project
- jquery
- npm module x, y anx z
```
- time needed for each step
```estimated time: 5 minutes```
- Steps
steps should be similar to the format we use in installing buddycloud (http://centerforopenneuroscience.org/install)- to the point of being mostly copy/paste-able.
eg:
```
1. download the skeleton project from...
2. unpack the project into <directory>
```

Recipee ideas
-------------

- Add chat to your webapp recipe
- geolocation sharing
- webrtc calling
- private dropbox
- facewall with buddycloud.js
- meatmap (capture the geoloc, place the captured image onto a map)
- meatpile (capture the photo, drop it into a pile on the screen)
- Build a secure "WhatsApp" proof of concept (using GPG and ./public-key node.)
- Build and open source "Vine video messaging" using open protocols.
- Create a "meat map" with recorded videos from other people running the demo.
- Share files using a QR code, upload any file to the QR code (which is actually the API endpoint, or something like that) 
- Build a public Dropbox. 100% DMCA free. (using the media server)
- Meatspac.es clone built on buddycloud (it's forkable at https://github.com/meatspaces/meatspace-chat)
